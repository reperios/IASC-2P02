## [When film cameras meet Instagram]

Ali is a senior in University and a photography major who is scrambling to meet deadlines as her thesis fast approaches. She has a gallery exhibition tomorrow as a part of her thesis concept “Wilderness”. Normally, she would shoot the photos a week or even two in advance to have time to develop them, scan them, edit them and submit them, however, because of personal projects for her Instagram and portfolio, she could not get to her thesis. Today is the day that changes. She is accompanied by Maddy, an animator, and Jia, a freelance photographer, and they are on their way to the mountain trails, to do her thesis photoshoot before tomorrow’s deadline.  

Ali packed the essentials, two rolls of film with 36 photos of 35mm each, portable screen lights with batteries, her tripod, and her camera. Her camera is expensive, not a luxury certainly, but she worked for years to afford it. Newer cameras from the past years are more portable and less flimsy than in the past. The film roll has also evolved into better image quality and fewer flare-ups.    

When they’re all settling in, Ali sets her camera down the trail among the greenery and the trees and begins to take her photos, while Jia and Maddy settle down at the top of a few rocks. Ali makes conversation while prepping the camera settings for the wilderness.   

“How’s freelance life, Jia?” Ali asks as she begins taking photos.   

“Yeah, I have to go to the Baseball game, take a couple of shots while my buddy writes about the event, and hurry up so I can get to the communal darkroom in 6th Avenue in time to develop them, edit them a bit and hand them to the papers to print in the morning,” Jia says.    

Because of the high price of photography, professional photographers have become scarce but well renowned. Although photography as a medium has become widely available, some people cannot afford to take photos of their own so the demands for newspapers, galleries, and social media work are high. Alongside film, animation has become the ruler of television because of the resources available for digital media. Of course, there are still amateur photographers, like Luk, Ali’s brother. He has single-use cameras, which are relatively cheap, portable, and less complex to learn. Many people have these types of cameras to take photos during family gatherings and pretty landscapes. These people often make use of communal darkrooms and scanners to digitize their photos and share them on Instagram and any other social media with their close friends. 

“You still haven’t gotten your license?” Maddy asks.     

“For the darkroom? No, I have the qualifications but I’m still a few paychecks away” Jia responds.    

Ali takes another photo while making a mental note to apply for the license herself. Normally, people need a license to develop photos on their own or even own a darkroom since strong chemicals are still used in developing films. They have gotten less strong with time, but you need to be a certain age with a degree of knowledge in photography and film. It is expensive, but worth it for convenience. Ali also believes it is fun to see paper go from nothing to something, especially if she gets to see her work appear in paper-like magic.   

“How about you Maddy? What is life?” Ali asks while reworking the camera settings to focus the shot on another composition.

“It’s pretty great! Still working in the animation series at Netflix” Maddy says.

With the ever-growing digital community, animated films, and industries have been on the rise. It is a big deal as it is a big part of people’s entertainment to escape reality, filling up theaters and screens at home.    

Ali takes a break from trying to figure out her camera settings to scroll over Instagram. The three of them have big followings, each with their unique approach to art. Ali scrolls, while hearting each picture she encounters. She also goes through the likes, forums, and comments of her most recent posts hyping up her up-coming gallery.  

Over the years, Instagram had become a place where anything with artistic value was posted. People encounter all kinds of art there- animations, collages, edits, illustrations, poetry, and other pieces of writings. Photography and film are the least produced because not many people are willing to go through the process of learning how to shoot with an analog camera, buying multiple rolls of films, and waiting for it to develop the film, to then scan it, edit it and post it. Therefore, Ali was grateful to have this platform to share her art and hopefully get her to be seen by others. After all, Instagram is the portfolio of many people with social network connections within the artistic industry.   

After her break, she takes a couple more photos and finishes before sunset. Ali reaches for her phone to check for the availability in the dark rooms on her University page to develop her film.   

“Uh oh” Ali begins, “I should’ve expected this, it’s finals season, everyone is cramming their projects, and developing their films. There is no availability in the uni. How long will it take to develop in communal rooms, Jia?”.    

“Since you have no credentials to develop your film yet so you will have to send the film and wait for it to be developed, which as you know, normally takes one to two days,” Jia says.    

“I don’t have that kind of time. What am I going to do?” Ali asks in an exasperated voice.     

“Oh you can come to mine,” Maddy offers, “You won’t have to wait long for the photos to develop since I’m the only one that rarely uses the darkroom in my house”.    

It’s true. Maddy comes from a rich family and usually, they can afford to have their own darkroom and all the rolls of film they desire. For the common folk, this is a luxury.

“You’re a lifesaver, Maddy, let’s go!” Ali began sprinting down the trail.    

When they arrive at Maddy’s house, Ali goes into her darkroom and a few hours later all of her photos are developed and left to dry.   

When they all dry, she asks Maddy for the scanner. She scans each one individually while making sure none of the photos are cropped. The scanners make for a great way to digitize the analog to pass them to a digital platform. She opens up Photoshop on her laptop and begins to edit.  

Ali’s style is special in the way that it is old. While Jia usually edits her photos to remove the “film” aesthetic, like the exposure and the vignettes, Ali makes it more prominent. She learned it in her mom’s work. Her mom told her tales of old film cameras, very big machines that created light flare-ups, noise, vignettes, and discoloration, and how these things by societal standards now are seen as imperfections but are unique to film itself. Since then, Ali became obsessed with the retro part of photography. Analog cameras and film rolls have evolved since then, many of them having minimal “imperfections” unless taken a certain way, so Ali resorts to editing to make each of them stand out on their own. She learned how to edit grain, noise, light flares, exposure, and vignettes for a retro look in modern shots as her photography style.

She finishes the last one right before the clock hits 4 A.M. She transfers them to her drive and from her phone she uploads it to Instagram as you would any other photo, select it from the file, put a caption, and upload.  

Ali has always liked galleries because they resemble cinemas. They are a big deal in town to support local talent and get out of the house. Over the few hours, her Instagram posts gathered much attention, and many creatives showed up to support her. She ended up winning a ribbon for “Unique Editing” and got a job offer for a magazine called “The Vintage Internet”.

## Micro Essay

Throughout the story, Ali shows the process of working with a film camera in a digital world and how the combination of digital and analog tools makes a difference in the culture surrounding media dynamics. It represents the past and the present and it shows that analog cameras and film rolls have evolved through the years, demonstrating the newness of old media. The story combines the use of digitized media such as social media, scanners, and photo editing software like Photoshop to transform analog media in order to adapt it into the current digital space. It is during these situations that "notions of old and new at times become indistinct" (Parikka, 2012). The disappearance of digital cameras not only has an impact on the overall cultural landscape but also allows for experimentation with analog media. It offers speculative insight into the possibilities of combining media; the combination of scanners, and digital tools with analog film, and how this combination transcends current cultural thinking. The combination of media can also be the middle man, in which the production can look into the future, as film cameras have evolved over time, or revert to the past, as Ali did with her retro editing with modern software. The story offers a reality in which functions of "old" media, such as film, can get blurred with the functions of "new" media, such as Instagram, and can even open the path to new media yet to be explored.
